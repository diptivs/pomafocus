# PomaFocus #

## Introduction:

* The goal of PomaFocus is to help user to be more productive. To achieve this, the PomaFocus helps user to adapt Pomodoro technique easily by scheduling and rescheduling the tasks for user, providing proper reminders and monitoring the status of tasks.
* PomaFocus will manage scheduling of tasks, notifications, and approximate timing to completion. The tool will be integrated with Google calendar, which will allow it to schedule tasks around existing meetings. 
* Each task wonâ€™t necessarily be complete within 25 minutes, thus, the tool will make sure to keep track of how many pomodoros (25 minute intervals) it took to complete the task. 
[PomaFocus](http://pomafocus.com/) is a highly intelligble fully functioning task management service. It builds upon the ideas [pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique). Through PomaFocus, not only you create projects/ tasks, but we schedule your day/ week out for you! That way you can be more productive and focus on the tasks at hand.
